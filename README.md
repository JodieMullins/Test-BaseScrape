# Test-BaseScrape


I wanted to scrape a website and throw that informatin into a database, so I started with a FreeCodeAcademy Scrapy tutorial. After utilizing spiders to pull data from html elements within bookstoscrape.com, configuring pipelines to clean it, and exporting it to a csv file, I want to upload the data into a database to further analyze. 



### Completed:
* Create Spiders / Get Data
* Clean / Output data into a csv file




### In Progress:
* Insert data into sqlite3 database




### To Do: 
* Query Data
* Visualizations / Insight reports
